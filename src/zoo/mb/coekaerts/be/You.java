 * 
 * Introduction
 * 
 * 
 * This is the first in a series of Java puzzles, that put your Java skills to
 * the test, in a challenging and fun way! A puzzle consists of some given Java
 * code with a line in it that seems to be impossible to reach. Itï¿½s up to you
 * to find the hole in it, abuse a subtle behavior of Java to make execution
 * reach that line anyways.
 * 
 * There almost aren't any rules; any cheating inside your code is allowed; it
 * is the whole point of the puzzle. [Clarification: Cheating the environment is
 * not]. You must run with the security manager enabled (java
 * -Djava.security.manager), otherwise it would be too easy (with setAccessible
 * for example). [Update: Use common sense, and see the exact rules if you're in
 * doubt]. The puzzle
 * 
 * How can you fit 20 clowns into a Volkswagen? Two classes are given: an empty
 * Clown class, and a Volkswagen class to which you can add clowns. When you try
 * to add a Clown, it is checked that it isn't already full. But if you just try
 * hard enough, there's always room for some extra clowns'
 * 
 * Write a class that when executed pushes 20 clowns into the little car, and
 * reaches the marked line. Here is one that won't really work, just to get you
 * started:
